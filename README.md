# Firebase Asynchronous Data Access Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase's asynchronous data retrieval methods.  The bug arises from attempting to access data from a Firebase query before the data has finished loading.  The solution showcases how to properly handle asynchronous operations using promises or async/await to ensure data integrity.

## Bug Description

When querying data from Firebase (e.g., using `onSnapshot` or `get()`), the data retrieval is asynchronous.  Accessing the data before the query completes results in `undefined` or `null` values, leading to unexpected errors and crashes.  This is a common pitfall for developers new to Firebase.

## Solution

The solution demonstrates the proper way to handle Firebase's asynchronous nature using `async/await` to ensure the data is loaded before being accessed.  This prevents errors and ensures data integrity.
