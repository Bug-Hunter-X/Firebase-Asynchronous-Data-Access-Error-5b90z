The issue lies in the asynchronous nature of Firebase operations.  When you attempt to access data from a Firebase query (e.g., using `onSnapshot` or `get()`), the data might not be immediately available. Trying to use this data before it's fully loaded leads to errors such as `undefined` or `null` values.
